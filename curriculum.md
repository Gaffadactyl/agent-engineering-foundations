# Foundations Curriculum

## Track: Agent Engineering Foundations
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Locked  

This curriculum defines the minimum foundation required before introducing AI agents or frameworks.

---

## Session 0 — Environment & Execution
**Goal:** Understand what happens when code runs  
**Artifacts:** Execution script + reflection  
**Gate:** Can explain how Python executes a file and how to read errors  

---

## Session 1 — Data Representation
**Goal:** Represent information in a structured, deterministic way  
**Concepts:** Strings, functions, dictionaries, input/output  
**Artifact:** `src/summarize_task.py`  
**Gate:** Correct structure + clear reasoning  

---

## Session 2 — Control Flow
**Goal:** Make decisions safely  
**Concepts:** Boolean logic, if/else, guardrails  
**Artifact:** `src/classify_task.py`  
**Gate:** Can explain why checks exist and what happens without them  

---

## Session 3 — Repetition & State
**Goal:** Process multiple items predictably  
**Concepts:** Lists, loops, accumulation  
**Artifact:** `src/process_tasks.py`  
**Gate:** Can explain loops as reasoning cycles

## Completion Criteria
This track is complete only when:
- All session artifacts exist
- All session reflections are written
- Each gate is passed explicitly
