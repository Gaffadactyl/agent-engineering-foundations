# Agent Engineering Foundations

## Purpose
This repository captures the **foundational skills required to build AI agents from first principles**.

It is intentionally framework-free and focuses on:
- Clear thinking in code
- Deterministic behavior
- Explicit data representation
- Control flow and state
- Professional software development habits

This is **not** a tutorial dump.
It is a **record of disciplined learning and proof of understanding**.

---

## What This Repo Covers
- Python fundamentals relevant to agents
- Data representation and flow
- Decision-making and guardrails
- Repetition and state
- Session-based learning with explicit artifacts

---

## What This Repo Does NOT Cover (Yet)
- LLM APIs
- Agent frameworks
- Tool calling
- Databases
- Async systems
- Frontend interfaces

Those appear only after foundations are proven.

## How to Use This Repo
Each session:
1. Introduces a small set of concepts
2. Produces a concrete artifact in `src/`
3. Captures reasoning and reflection in `sessions/`
4. Is gated before progression
